2020-12-12,"Jane, it’s me, Funny-face. You love Frank Drebin. And Frank Drebin loves you. Jane, listen to me, if you don’t love me, you might as well pull that trigger, because, without you, I wouldn’t want to live anyway.I’ve finally found someone I can love – a good, clean love… without utensils. It’s a topsy-turvy world, Jane, and maybe the problems of two people don’t amount to a hill of beans, but this is our hill and these are our beans. Since I met you, I’ve noticed things I never knew were there – birds singing, dew glistening on a newly-formed leaf, stop lights. Jane, this morning, I bought something for you. It’s not very much, but pretty good for an honest policeman’s salary. It’s an engagement ring. I’d have given it to you earlier, but I wanted to wait until we were alone. I love you, Jane."
